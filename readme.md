# DSA

This repository servers as my DSA practice. As I read the Introduction to Algorithm book, I will be implementing DSA algorithms in C, Go and Typescript.

## Plan

- Read 8 Pages of the [Introduction To Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-fourth-Thomas-Cormen/dp/026204630X/ref=pd_vtp_h_pd_vtp_h_d_sccl_3/138-3087415-5603914?pd_rd_w=dLGMY&content-id=amzn1.sym.a5db9a55-4933-4d47-a889-f891effcaf02&pf_rd_p=a5db9a55-4933-4d47-a889-f891effcaf02&pf_rd_r=NPRFNQ4FREEFK6S0YJ3A&pd_rd_wg=UyneV&pd_rd_r=b925492a-179c-42aa-a7f6-f89c3d941583&pd_rd_i=026204630X&psc=1) book each day.
- Write code for each algorithm I learn in C, Go and Typescript.
- Do complexity analysis of each code and include benchmark results in the report.
- Write a bunch of real world example and usecases for each algorithm and write test cases for each one.
- Write the pros and the cons of each algorithm.
- Take notes as you read the book
